# Empress
Empress is a flexible microframework for creating async web applications, based on Amp concurrency framework.
Its name is a portmanteau of Express and Amp as Empress's simplicity was first inspired by Express.js. Ultimately it's also the name
of one of the cards from Major Arcana, a part of the tarot deck.
