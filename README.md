### Work in progress âš¡
Empress is a flexible PHP 8 microframework for creating async web applications. It's based on [amphp/http-server](https://github.com/amphp/http-server).
The name is a portmanteau of Express and Amp as Empress's simplicity was first inspired by Express.js. Later, many useful ideas were incorporated from [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) and [Javalin](https://javalin.io/). Ultimately it's also the name of one of the cards from major arcana, part of the tarot deck.
